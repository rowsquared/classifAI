# Deployment Guide

This guide covers production deployment for classiflow. The app provides the UI and database for classification workflows. AI labeling and learning are optional and come from the separate Taxomind service.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (and Docker Compose) or a container platform
- PostgreSQL 12+
- A domain with HTTPS (recommended for production)
- Environment variables (see below)

## Option 1: Docker Compose (app + Postgres)

Use this when you want the app and database deployed together.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classiflow.git
cd classiflow
```

2. Copy the environment template and set secure values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the stack:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

4. Open your domain or http://localhost:3000, log in, and change the default admin password.

Note: For local access you must expose port 3000 in `docker-compose.yml`. For production behind a reverse proxy, you can keep ports internal and route traffic through your proxy.

## Option 2: App container + external Postgres

Use this when you already manage PostgreSQL elsewhere.

1. Set `DATABASE_URL` to point at your Postgres instance.
2. Provide all required auth and admin environment variables.
3. Ensure the container start command runs migrations and initializes the admin user:

```bash
sh -c "npx prisma migrate deploy && node scripts/init-admin.js && node server.js"
```

The default Dockerfile runs `node server.js` only, so you must override the start command in your platform (Kubernetes, ECS, Fly.io, etc.).

## Environment Variables

Required:
- DATABASE_URL
- AUTH_URL
- AUTH_TRUST_HOST
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME

Optional AI labeling (Taxomind service):
- AI_LABELING_API_URL
- AI_LABELING_API_KEY
- AI_LABELING_BATCH_SIZE
- AI_LEARNING_BATCH_SIZE
- AI_LEARNING_MIN_NEW_ANNOTATIONS
- AI_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL_MS
- AI_JOB_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS

See `ENV_SETUP.md` for details.

## Health Check

Use the health endpoint to verify the deployment:

```
GET /api/health
```

## Admin User

On first start, the default admin user is created from the environment variables. You must change the password after the first login. To reset, update `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and restart the app.

## Backups

Back up your PostgreSQL database regularly. Example with Docker:

```bash
docker exec classiflow-postgres pg_dump -U classiflow classiflow > backup.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Database does not exist**: Ensure the database is created and the name matches `DATABASE_URL`.
- **AI labeling returns 404**: Verify `AI_LABELING_API_URL` points to the Taxomind service base path.
