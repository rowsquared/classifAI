# classifAI

Complex classifications made easy.

Open-source. AI-assisted. User-friendly.
Built for ISCO, ISIC, COICOP, and beyond.

classifAI is an open-source labeling platform for hierarchical classifications. It provides the user interface and database for classification workflows.
AI labeling and learning are handled by the separate Taxomind service (https://github.com/rowsquared/taxomind). You can run classifAI without AI and connect it later.

## Why classifAI

- Faster classifications with AI-assisted suggestions reviewed by humans
- Higher quality with review and double-annotation workflows
- Simple process management with assignments and progress tracking
- Open-source and self-hosted so you stay in control

## Highlights

- Multi-level taxonomies (up to 5 levels) with CSV import and custom level names
- Fast labeling UI with search, keyboard shortcuts, flags, and comments
- Optional AI suggestions and learning via Taxomind
- Role-based access for admins, supervisors, and labellers
- Progress analytics and team performance dashboards
- Flexible workflows with assignments and sign-offs

## Getting started

The simplest way to try classifAI is with Docker Compose.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classifai.git
cd classifai
```

2. Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. For local access, uncomment the app port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (3000:3000).
4. Optional: enable AI suggestions by deploying Taxomind and setting `AI_LABELING_API_URL` and `AI_LABELING_API_KEY` in `.env`.
5. Start the stack:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
6. Open http://localhost:3000, log in with the default admin, and change the password.
