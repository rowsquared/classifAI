# Coolify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the classifai application on Coolify.

## Prerequisites

- A Coolify instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Git repository access

## Deployment Methods

There are two ways to deploy this application in Coolify:

1. **Docker Compose (Recommended)** - Includes PostgreSQL in the same deployment
2. **Dockerfile Only** - Requires separate PostgreSQL database

---

## Method 1: Docker Compose Deployment (Recommended)

This method deploys both the application and PostgreSQL database together using docker-compose.yml.

### 1. Create the Application

1. Navigate to **Projects** → **Add New Resource** → **Application**
2. Select your Git provider and repository
3. Configure deployment settings:
   - **Build Pack**: Select `docker-compose`
   - **Docker Compose Location**: `./docker-compose.yml`
   - **Port**: `3000`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables in Coolify:

#### Required Variables

```env
# PostgreSQL Configuration (will be used by the embedded database)
POSTGRES_USER=classifai
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=generate-a-secure-password-here
POSTGRES_DB=classifai

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

# Default Admin User
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME=Admin User
DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin  # Optional: defaults to username extracted from email if not set
```

#### Optional AI Labeling Variables

```env
# AI Labeling Service (if using)
AI_LABELING_API_URL=https://your-ai-service.example.com
AI_LABELING_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
AI_LABELING_BATCH_SIZE=100
AI_LEARNING_BATCH_SIZE=100
AI_LEARNING_MIN_NEW_ANNOTATIONS=500
AI_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=5000
AI_JOB_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS=600000
```

### 3. Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET

Generate a secure secret for NextAuth:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Use the output as your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value.

### 4. Configure Volumes (Important!)

Coolify should automatically create the volume for PostgreSQL data persistence, but verify:

1. Check that `postgres_data` volume is created
2. This ensures your database persists across deployments

### 5. Deploy

1. Click **Deploy** to start the deployment
2. Monitor the build logs
3. Coolify will:
   - Build the application Docker image
   - Start PostgreSQL container
   - Start the application container
   - Run database migrations automatically
   - **Automatically create the default admin user** (if it doesn't exist)
4. Access your application at your configured domain

### 6. Verify Deployment

Check the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-25T...",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 7. Admin User Auto-Creation

The default admin user is **automatically created** on first deployment using the environment variables you set:

- **Email**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- **Username**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` (or extracted from email if not set)
- **Password**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- **Name**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME`

**Important Notes:**
- The admin user is only created if it doesn't already exist
- You can login with either the **username** or **email** address
- You **must change the password** on first login (forced password reset)
- If you need to reset the admin password, update `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and restart the container

---

## Troubleshooting

### `database "<name>" does not exist`
- This happens when `DATABASE_URL` points to a DB name that wasn't created. If you changed `POSTGRES_DB`/`DATABASE_URL` after the first deploy, the existing Postgres volume will not auto-create the new DB.
- Fix options:
  1. **Fresh volume** (wipes data): in Coolify redeploy with the `Remove volumes` option (or delete the `postgres_data` volume) so Postgres reinitializes with the current `POSTGRES_DB`.
  2. **Keep data**: connect to the Postgres container and create the DB manually, e.g. `psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -c "CREATE DATABASE <db> OWNER $POSTGRES_USER;"`.
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` in the app matches the DB name you create.

### AI labeling API returns `Not Found`
- The base URL is set via `AI_LABELING_API_URL`. It must point at the service root that serves the expected endpoints (e.g., `/learn`, `/learn/{jobId}/status`, `/label`).
- If the provider uses a prefix (e.g., `/api`), include it in `AI_LABELING_API_URL` (e.g., `https://taxomind-api.rowsquared.org/api`).
- Verify with `curl -i "$AI_LABELING_API_URL/learn"`; a 200/401/403 indicates you hit the right service, a 404 means the base path is wrong.

---

## Method 2: Dockerfile Deployment (Separate Database)

Use this method if you want to manage PostgreSQL separately or use Coolify's managed database.

### 1. Create PostgreSQL Database

In your Coolify dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Databases** → **Add New Database**
2. Select **PostgreSQL**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `classifai-db`
   - **PostgreSQL Version**: `16` (or latest)
   - **Username**: `classifai`
   - **Password**: Generate a secure password
   - **Database Name**: `classifai`
4. Click **Create**
5. Note the internal connection string

### 2. Create the Application

1. Navigate to **Projects** → **Add New Resource** → **Application**
2. Select your Git provider and repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build Pack**: `dockerfile`
   - **Dockerfile Location**: `./Dockerfile`
   - **Port**: `3000`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```env
# Database (use the connection string from the separate database)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://classifai:your-password@classifai-db:5432/classifai?schema=public

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

# Default Admin User
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME=Admin User
DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin  # Optional: defaults to username extracted from email if not set
```

### 4. Add Start Command

In Coolify, set the start command to run migrations and initialize admin:

```bash
sh -c "npx prisma migrate deploy && node scripts/init-admin.js && node server.js"
```

**Note**: The `init-admin.js` script automatically creates the default admin user if it doesn't exist, using the environment variables you configured.

### 5. Deploy

1. Click **Deploy** to start the deployment
2. Monitor the build logs
3. Once deployed, the database migrations will run automatically
4. Access your application at your configured domain

## Post-Deployment

### First Login

1. Navigate to your application URL
2. Login with the default admin credentials:
   - **Username or Email**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` (or `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` if set)
   - **Password**: Value from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
3. **Important**: You **must** change your password immediately after first login (forced password reset)

**Note**: The admin user is automatically created during deployment. Check the deployment logs to confirm it was created successfully.

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically on each deployment via the start command. If you need to run migrations manually:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Verify Deployment

Check the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-25T...",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## Important Notes

### Database Persistence

When using **Method 1 (Docker Compose)**:
- PostgreSQL data is stored in a Docker volume (`postgres_data`)
- This volume persists across container restarts and redeployments
- **Important**: Always configure backups for production use

### Networking

The docker-compose setup creates an internal network where:
- The app container connects to PostgreSQL using hostname `postgres`
- PostgreSQL is only accessible within the Docker network (secure by default)
- Only port 3000 is exposed externally for the application

### Database Backups

#### For Docker Compose Deployment:

You can create manual backups by running:

```bash
# Backup
docker exec classifai-postgres pg_dump -U classifai classifai > backup.sql

# Restore
cat backup.sql | docker exec -i classifai-postgres psql -U classifai classifai
```

For automated backups, consider:
- Setting up a cron job to backup the Docker volume
- Using Coolify's backup commands if available
- Implementing external backup solutions

#### For Separate Database Deployment:

Coolify provides built-in backup functionality:
1. Go to your PostgreSQL database settings in Coolify
2. Navigate to **Backups**
3. Configure backup schedule and retention
4. Enable backups

### Scaling

To scale the application:

1. Go to your application settings
2. Adjust **Replicas** count (requires load balancer)
3. Note: Database connections may need adjustment for multiple instances

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue**: ESLint errors during build
- **Solution**: The `next.config.ts` is configured with `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`
- **Reason**: Minor ESLint warnings are acceptable and don't affect functionality
- **Note**: You can still run `pnpm lint` separately to review warnings

**Issue**: `npm install` or `pnpm install` fails
- **Solution**: The Dockerfile now uses `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` with fallback to `npm install`
- **Cause**: Dependency conflicts or lockfile issues in containerized builds
- **Fix**: The Dockerfile copies prisma schema before install and uses npm for better compatibility

**Issue**: Prisma client generation fails
- **Solution**: Ensure all Prisma schema files are properly copied
- The build process generates Prisma client before building Next.js

**Issue**: Prisma schema not found during install
- **Solution**: The Dockerfile now copies the prisma directory before running npm install
- **Reason**: The postinstall script needs the schema to generate the Prisma client
- **Note**: This is why we copy `prisma` folder early in the build process

### Runtime Issues

**Issue**: Database connection fails
- **Solution**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` uses the correct internal hostname
- Check database is running and accessible

**Issue**: 503 errors on health check
- **Solution**: Check database connection string
- Verify migrations have run successfully
- Check application logs in Coolify

### Migration Issues

**Issue**: Migrations don't run
- **Solution**: Ensure start command includes `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Check write permissions for Prisma

**Issue**: Migration fails with permissions error
- **Solution**: Verify database user has CREATE/ALTER permissions

### Port Allocation Issues

**Issue**: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated`
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL port mapping conflicts in Coolify
- **Solution**: Port mappings should be commented out in docker-compose for Coolify
- **Fix**: Lines 16-17 should be commented (as configured by default)

**Issue**: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated`
- **Cause**: App port mapping conflicts - Coolify manages ports externally
- **Solution**: Port mappings should be commented out in docker-compose for Coolify
- **Fix**: Lines 34-35 should be commented (as configured by default)
- **Note**: For local testing, these ports MUST be uncommented

**Issue**: Can't access app at localhost:3000 locally
- **Cause**: Port mapping commented out (Coolify configuration)
- **Solution**: Uncomment lines 34-35 in docker-compose.yml for local testing

## Environment-Specific Notes

### Production Recommendations

1. Use strong passwords for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
2. Change default admin password immediately after first login
3. Enable database backups
4. Configure SSL/TLS (handled by Coolify)
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
6. Review and adjust resource limits

### Persistent Storage

The application uses PostgreSQL for all persistent data. Ensure:

- Database volume is persisted in Coolify
- Regular backups are configured
- Backup retention meets your requirements

## Support

- **classifai application**: Check the main README.md
- **Coolify deployment**: Visit [Coolify Documentation](https://coolify.io/docs)
- **Prisma migrations**: Visit [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs)

## Local Testing with Docker

Before deploying to Coolify, test locally:

### Important: Port Mapping Configuration

The docker-compose files are configured for Coolify deployment by default (ports commented out). For local testing, you MUST uncomment the port mappings:

1. **Edit docker-compose.yml**:
   - Uncomment lines 34-35 for app port mapping (3000:3000) - **REQUIRED for local access**
   - Optionally uncomment lines 16-17 for PostgreSQL if you need direct database access

2. **Run locally**:
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values
nano .env

# Clean Docker cache completely (important for Prisma version)
docker-compose down -v
docker builder prune -af
docker system prune -af

# Build and run (with --no-cache to ensure fresh build)
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Before deploying to Coolify**, remember to:
   - Comment out the port mappings again (or use git to restore the original file)
   - Commit and push your changes

## Updating the Application

To update your deployment:

1. Push changes to your Git repository
2. Coolify will automatically rebuild (if auto-deploy is enabled)
3. Or manually trigger deployment in Coolify dashboard
4. Migrations run automatically on each deployment
